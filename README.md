# diamond-crusher

## Strategy
Maximize the average number of diamonds the collector returns to the base per step in a limited time span. To do that, the collector must step as fast and smart as possible.

* Reset the board when average diamond distance from the collectors base is too high
* Increase the concentration of diamonds by spawning bots that do nothing except occupy space
* Make sure the collector spawns reasonably centered
